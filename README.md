# RootLink
The mission behind RootLink is to bridge gaps between separated families and foster healing through secure, informed connections. We aim to provide adoptees and their biological families with the tools and support they need to navigate the complexities of adoption reunions successfully.

## Technologies used
The PERN stack was used, with TypeScript for type checking, Zustand for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling on the front-end. SocketIO for real-time messaging. A secondary Flask server in Python was employed for processing profile similarity with Machine Learning. Pandas was used to group and filter profiles, facilitating the implementation of our ML algorithm. Aside from our Postgres database, Firebase was used for file uploading.
